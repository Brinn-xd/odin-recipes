    <p>a Neapolitan-like pizza, typically made with tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, garlic, fresh basil, and extra-virgin olive oil. Think of it as a less basic cheese pizza that's still quite as easy to make.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>1/4 recipe homemade pizza crust </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons marinara sauce </li>
        <li>1 clove garlic , minced</li>
        <li>3 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese , sliced into 1/4-inch thick pieces</li>
        <li>1 Roma tomato , sliced</li>
        <li>2 large basil leaves , sliced into ribbons</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
     </ul>

     <h2>Directions</h2>

     <ol>
        <li>Place a pizza stone in the oven. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F, allowing the stone to get hot.</li>
        <li>Shape the pizza dough on a floured surface into an 8-inch round, making it 1/4-inch thick. Transfer it to a pizza peel lined with parchment paper. Reshape if necessary.</li>
        <li>Gently brush the dough with the olive oil, then evenly spread the marinara sauce on, leaving a 1-inch border around the edge. Sprinkle the garlic over the top. Top with the mozzarella slices and tomatoes, leaving space in between.</li>
        <li>Slide the parchment with the crust onto the heated stone. Bake for 8-10 minutes until crust is golden and cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and sprinkle the basil over the top, along with 1-2 grinds of fresh black pepper.</li>
        <li>Cut into wedges and serve immediately.</li>
     </ol>

      <h2>Cooking Tips</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>Bake your pizza in a very hot oven (generally 500-550 degrees F.)</li>
        <li>Use a good, heavy, baking stone or steel. They hold tons of heat energy, releasing it quickly into a pizza as it bakes, giving it a crispier crust.</li>
        <li>The better the ingredients, the better the pizza. The fresh sauce, coupled with fresh mozzarella and basil are going to make the flavors of this pizza sing.</li>
       </ul>
